                <p>The story of Serai Hotel began with a dream to revive the lost art of true hospitality. Located in the heart of Islamabad, Pakistan, the hotel was inspired by the ancient caravanserais—resting places that once welcomed travelers from distant lands. These serai were not just shelters; they were sanctuaries where merchants, explorers, and wanderers paused their journeys, found safety, and shared stories. Serai Hotel was born from this timeless spirit—a desire to create a modern-day haven where each guest would find not just comfort, but warmth, peace, and belonging.</p>

            <div class="section2">
                <p id="section2-p1">When Serai Hotel first opened its doors, it was built with a focus on elegance, privacy, and thoughtful detail. Unlike large hotel chains that often focus on numbers, Serai chose to focus on people. Every element—from the soft textures of the linens to the gentle lighting in each corridor—was chosen to create an experience of quiet luxury.</p>

                <p id="section2-p2">The founders believed that hospitality should be personal, not transactional. They wanted their guests to feel cared for, not just served. This belief became the foundation of Serai Hotel’s reputation—a place where guests are not simply accommodated, but sincerely welcomed.</p>

            <div class="section3">
                <p>Over time, Serai Hotel earned a trusted name, welcoming diplomats, artists, business travelers, and families who returned for its peaceful atmosphere and sincere service. The hotel embraced modern booking technologies to better serve its guests but never lost its core values. Serai remains a graceful sanctuary where life slows, and every guest is invited to rest and feel at home.</p>
